description: Nathan Disidore - software engineer building distributed systems, edge infrastructure, and developer tools.
---

I'm Nathan - a software engineer with a computer engineering background and over a decade of experience building systems that scale. I'm drawn to problems at the intersection of infrastructure and developer experience, where good abstractions can make complex things feel simple.

## What I Do

I'm currently a founding engineer at [Terminal Industries](https://terminal-industries.com/), where we're reimagining global shipping and logistics using computer vision and edge computing. I work across the stack - from bootstrapping multi-tenant infrastructure and building Temporal-based workflow engines to managing a fleet of 100+ edge devices with custom observability tooling.

Before Terminal, I spent nearly five years at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) across three teams. Most recently I worked on [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/), designing custom vector storage formats for edge-native AI workloads. Before that, I helped build and launch [Workers for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/), extending the V8 runtime for multi-tenant execution. I started on the Internal Tools team, where I architected the customer alerting platform and operated Kafka infrastructure processing over a trillion messages daily.

I'm most at home working in Go, Rust, and TypeScript - from distributed backends and workflow engines to developer tooling and frontend. I believe the best infrastructure is invisible: it should get out of the way and let developers focus on what they're building. I'm also interested in how AI can augment development workflows without replacing the satisfaction of building something yourself.

## Interests

When I'm not at the keyboard, I'm probably tinkering with hardware projects on my [custom PC](/uses) or [Framework laptop](/uses), contributing to open source, or throwing discs on a disc golf course. I also enjoy swing dancing when I can find a good venue and the occasional late-night rave.

I'm currently deepening my understanding of distributed systems patterns, exploring the Rust ecosystem for systems programming, and experimenting with local-first software architectures. Always rotating between technical papers and science fiction.

## This Site

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com), and hosted on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com). It's an ongoing project - always tweaking the design and adding new sections. Check out [what I'm working on now](/now) or browse my [engineering principles](/principles).

## Contact

The best way to reach me is through [GitHub](https://github.com/ndisidore) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ndisidore). I'm always up for conversations about distributed systems, developer tools, or interesting engineering challenges.
